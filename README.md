#### Karl Vandooren - future dev

I'm Karl, new to developping and very excited about it. Let's make this first assignment a **great** one! 
My current skillset isn't that great for the moment but that means the possibilities are ***huge*** in the future !!

- I can learn whatever I want to ( you too )!
- I'm good at making misteaks
- > and I can do blockquotes now 
 

> I do love Nature and having hands dirty as well, it makes you connect with the "real world dev"
> I also like technology and improvements, the contrast between them but also how to connect them,
> but what I **really** love is :
> - My Family.
> - Cartoons.
> - Peri Peri Chicken (ghost pepper spice level).
>
> Among many other things


#### Objectives

My objective as developer is to be able to create some apps and programs to make some tasks easier, I do believe that even with the large choice we already get, that we could all benefit from some tasks to be sorted, I also think that small businesses could largely benefit to have apps to fit their specific needs.
I would also enjoy fiddling a bit in game dev, even as a *hobby*.

My fears as a developer are the many possibilities, and maybe wanting to jump on every train possible and not having enough time to do it. At this point, I have to be honest, developer job descriptions seems more complicated than the code itself, I'm looking forward to have a better grasp at it *soon*.

#### Team work make the dream work!

I'm really looking forward to collaborate with the team ! 
Different profiles, respect and good communication will always bring a richer view by :

1. Different perspectives and point of views.
2. Varying interests, so we can have a glimpse at different topics.
3. Same goal, same struggle makes the strongest bonds.
